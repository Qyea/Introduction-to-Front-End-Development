# Implement the second part of Weather app

### My api_key is 197dafdade01d3e785aecdfc076fbc89

**Task**
Implement the second part of Weather app according to the practical class.

**Dev notes:**

1. Check out the recording of a practical class
2. The code from a practical class for a reference: https://github.com/likx2/10-lesson

Try to not copy all from a practical class, come up with something similar (you can play with Bootstrap by adding different colors, font sizes, etc.)

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements
