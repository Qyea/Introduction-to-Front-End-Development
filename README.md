# Introduction to Front-End Development

This is a repository for storing in one place all the **practices** and **homework** on the subject at the **EPIC Institute of Technology**. 

There are two types of lessons and they can complement each other:

- Practice lessons
	> They contain the code that I repeated for the teacher during lectures and practices.

- Homework
	> Tasks to complete on your own. I will attach the text of the tasks.
