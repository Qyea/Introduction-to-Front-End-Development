# Finish the Portfolio website HTML structure

## Finish the Portfolio website HTML structure by adding a project section, and a footer.

**Requirements**

1.  A project section should have a title and a list of project cards.
2.  Every card should have a button (ex. “View more”) or be clickable to redirect a user to a separate project page. (For reference, check https://html-css-portfolioo.netlify.app/)
3.  Use a structure from a presentation (without an aside section)
4.  Every project page should have a title, description, and one or more images.

**Pay attention to:**
1.  Correct semantic tags
2.  Requirements!

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements.
