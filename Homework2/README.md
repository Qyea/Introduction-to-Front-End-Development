# Table element with random data

**Create a table element with random data with 4 rows and at least 4 columns.**
**Requirements**
1. A table with <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> on the top level
2. At least one colspan and rowspan attributes should be used
3. A <caption> element should be used.

**Dev notes**
Include this \<style>  element to the end of a <head>  element to add a border to your table cells.

\<style>
body  *  {
border:  1px  solid  black;
}
\</style>

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements.
